==================================
This repository contains a practice project for building an adaptive Android app using Jetpack Compose. The goal of this project is to take a pre-existing mobile-first app and adapt its layout and navigation to provide a better user experience on large-screen devices, such as tablets and foldable phones.

### Project Overview

This project is a **Sports app** that has been adapted to provide an optimal user experience across different screen sizes, from **mobile phones** to **large tablets** and **foldables**.

Starting with a **mobile-first design**, the app's layout and navigation have been modified to implement an **adaptive two-pane layout** for large screens.  

- The **list of sports** is displayed in a dedicated list pane on the left.  
- The **details of the selected sport** are displayed in a detail pane on the right.  
- Content is updated within the same screen, eliminating the need for navigation to a new screen.  

### Key Concepts & Features

This project reinforces several concepts from the **Android Basics in Compose** pathway and modern Android development practices:

- **Window Size Classes** ‚Äì Determines screen size using `WindowWidthSizeClass` and adapts layouts accordingly.  
- **Canonical Layouts** ‚Äì Implements list‚Äìdetail (two-pane) patterns for larger screens.  
- **Adaptive Navigation** ‚Äì Handles navigation changes based on screen size (new screen on small devices vs. pane updates on large screens).  
- **State Hoisting** ‚Äì Shares state (e.g., selected sport) between list and detail panes via hoisted state.  
- **Responsive Design** ‚Äì Provides an optimized UI for all device sizes.  
- **Modern Android Development** ‚Äì Built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material Design 3**.
